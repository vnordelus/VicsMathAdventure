🎉 Now Your Backend Can Connect Properly

Once the tables exist under vicsmath, we can:

✔ Connect your Node.js API to PostgreSQL
✔ Start saving user progress
✔ Load quizzes dynamically
✔ Add user accounts, leaderboard, achievements
✔ Prepare for full cloud deployment (Render, Railway, AWS, Azure)

✅ NEXT STEPS (Tell me when you're ready)

Create db.js connection file (with pooling & env variables)

Build the full API (users, quizzes, progress, events)

Connect your math game frontend to the API

Add authentication (signup/login)

Deploy PostgreSQL + backend + frontend to the cloud

Add more game modes, pages, advanced math concepts
